<p>&quot;The Dark Playground is a concept coined by Tim Urban in his popular blog, Wait But Why. It refers to a state of procrastination and avoidance, where an individual engages in unproductive activities instead of doing their intended work. This can be anything from mindlessly scrolling through social media, binge-watching TV shows, playing video games or engaging in any other activity that brings momentary pleasure, but ultimately leads to guilt and stress due to not accomplishing more meaningful tasks. It can be quite a frustrating and habit-forming cycle, but there are ways to break out of it with discipline and intentional effort.&quot; #GPT</p>
