I often lose a word that I want to say, and then have to stop what I'm saying to think of it. I just don't feel like I can communicate ideas coherently.</li>\n<li>Part of the problem arises because I'm a verbal processor, so I don't think about things unless I'm talking about them. However, I don't talk about things with people very often. This leads to me not developing thoughts on things very often. Generally I sit down to have a conversation with someone, and I don't have any thoughts to provide on the topic. So, I end up just sitting and letting them talk, and not having anything to say back. It's only after I've gone away from the conversation that I can come up with a response.</li>\n<li>And having said all that, I'm not completely</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When people reject your idea it's not as personal as it sometimes feels.\n<ul>\n<li>In the same vein, pretty often I'm reticent to share my ideas, because I'm afraid that people won't like them. I haven't had enough time to develop my thoughts, because I haven't been talking to people. This is just a vicious cycle where I don't do any thinking, and I don't do any talking.</li>\n<li>And when I do share my ideas, and people dislike them, I tend to take it hard, especially if they are ideas that I've spent a lot of time thinking about.</li>\n<li>I guess the upshot of all this is that I don't feel currently able to share my thoughts and ideas effectively. My goal for improving this is to do a lot more talking to myself. this will include techniques like talking quietly under my breath without moving my lips to slow down and focus my thought processes. I'll talk to myself about various topics that I want to develop thoughts on, then seek out a person to talk to about that topic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
